This folder contains all files and scripts to impelement a covert channel of the [Size Modulation](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.com/p/p1-size-modulation-pattern.html) hiding pattern. The covert channel mainly relies on `ncat`. See the [approach description](https://github.com/cdpxe/nefias/blob/master/recordings/covert_channel_size_modulation_pattern/covert_channel_size_mod_implementation/Description_of_the_approach.txt) for more details.

Additionally, the file [Size_Mod_1000_1001_300ms_0925_1800.pcap.csv](https://github.com/cdpxe/nefias/blob/master/recordings/covert_channel_size_modulation_pattern/covert_channel_size_mod_implementation/Size_Mod_1000_1001_300ms_0925_1800.pcap.csv) is a recording of such a channel that has no imperfections as in the other recordings. Thus, this file contains only packets with payload sizes of 1,000 and 1,001 bytes (excluding the packets of the TCP handshake).
