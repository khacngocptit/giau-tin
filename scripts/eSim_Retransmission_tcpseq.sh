# eSim_Retransmission_tcpseq.sh: calculate epsilon similarity scores based on sequence numbers of tcp retransmissions of flows
# This script receives the following parameters: ./script [chunk] [jobname]
# note: I recommend to use ~nefias/nefias as tmpfs to speed up the 'cat' command and to limit disk I/O!
