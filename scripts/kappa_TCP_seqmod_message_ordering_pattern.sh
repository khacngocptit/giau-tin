# kappa_TCP_seqmod_message_ordering_pattern.sh: calculate compressibility score
# to detect network covert channels that utilize the MESSAGE ORDERING pattern
# by artificually maniupulating the order of TCP packets. To achieve this, this
# script performs string operations of succeeding packet's sequence numbers
# as described by Wendzel, S.: Protocol-independent Detection of “Messaging
# Ordering” Network Covert Channels, in Proc. ARES (CUING Workshop), ACM, 2019.
# This script utilizes different window sizes to ease the process of finding
# a high-quality threshold for K.
#
# Further notes:
# - The window size used in the original paper was 200.
# - Four different ways to perform the string coding were proposed in the paper.
#   Only the best performing string coding variant is implemented in this NeFiAS
#   script.
#
# This script receives the following parameters: ./script [chunk] [jobname]
